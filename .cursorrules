# Cursor Project Rules

# Goal
- Build an AI-assisted legal citation graph using proven libraries for extraction/normalization (eyecite + reporters-db) and optional CourtListener for resolution.
- Minimize custom NLP; use LLMs only for tie-breaking and ambiguous linking.
- Maintain strict, typed data contracts end-to-end.

# Style & Constraints
- Prefer deterministic pipelines before any model call.
- Keep prompts in /cursor/ai and /cursor/prompts; keep product/eng context separate.
- No secret values in repo; reference .env.example only.
- Tests before features that rely on model calls.

# Autofix & Refactor
- When Cursor proposes code, ensure it aligns with /cursor/eng/api.contract.md and /cursor/eng/data.models.md.
- Any new dependency touching parsing must be added to /docs/decisions.md with rationale.
