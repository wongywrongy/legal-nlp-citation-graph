You are given a list of possibly malformed or partial legal citations extracted from a U.S. Supreme Court opinion titled "{{CASE}}". Your task is to return cleaned, structured citations in the format below.

Each output line must follow this structure:
<source_case> ||| <cited_case_name> ||| <volume> ||| <reporter> ||| <page> [||| <pin_cite>] [||| (<year>)] [||| (<parenthetical_info>)]

- If a field is missing, leave it blank but still include the separator.
- Normalize reporter abbreviations (e.g., "U. S." → "U.S.")
- Don’t include commentary, headings, or extra lines.
- Return only the structured citation lines, one per line.
